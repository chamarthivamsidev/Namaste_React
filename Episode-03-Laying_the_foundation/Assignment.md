- Role of type attribute in script tag ? What options can i use there ?
  - The `type` attribute in the `<script>` tag specifies the scripting language or media type of the code contained within the `<script>` element. It tells the browser how to interpret and execute the script. While JavaScript is the most common language used with `<script>` tags, the type attribute allows you to specify other scripting languages or data formats.
  - We can give options like `text/javascript`, `module`, `application/json` etc based on the requirement.
