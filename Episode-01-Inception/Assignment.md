- What is Emmet ?
  - Emmet is a web development toolkit that allows developers to write HTML and CSS code more quickly and efficiently. It's essentially a set of abbreviations and shortcuts that help streamline the process of writing repetitive or complex code. Emmet was originally developed as a plugin for text editors like Sublime Text and Visual Studio Code, but it has since become an integral part of many code editors and integrated development environments (IDEs).
  - Emmet works by utilizing a syntax that allows you to write short snippets that expand into complete HTML and CSS code blocks. For example, instead of typing out the full HTML structure manually, you can use an Emmet abbreviation like `html:5` and then expand it to generate the basic HTML5 structure:
- Difference between a Library and Framework ?
  - A library is a collection of pre-written code or functions that developers can use to perform specific tasks. Libraries are typically designed to be modular and focused on solving particular problems. Developers can include a library in their project and use its functions as needed.
  - A framework is a more comprehensive tool that provides a structured foundation for building applications. Unlike libraries, frameworks dictate the overall architecture and flow of the application. They often provide a skeleton structure that developers need to follow.
