- What is Emmet ?
  - Emmet is a web development toolkit that allows developers to write HTML and CSS code more quickly and efficiently. It's essentially a set of abbreviations and shortcuts that help streamline the process of writing repetitive or complex code. Emmet was originally developed as a plugin for text editors like Sublime Text and Visual Studio Code, but it has since become an integral part of many code editors and integrated development environments (IDEs).
  - Emmet works by utilizing a syntax that allows you to write short snippets that expand into complete HTML and CSS code blocks. For example, instead of typing out the full HTML structure manually, you can use an Emmet abbreviation like `html:5` and then expand it to generate the basic HTML5 structure: <br><br>
- Difference between a Library and Framework ?
  - A `library` is a collection of pre-written code or functions that developers can use to perform specific tasks. Libraries are typically designed to be modular and focused on solving particular problems. Developers can include a library in their project and use its functions as needed.
  - A `framework` is a more comprehensive tool that provides a structured foundation for building applications. Unlike libraries, frameworks dictate the overall architecture and flow of the application. They often provide a skeleton structure that developers need to follow. <br><br>
- What is CDN ? Why do we use it ?
  - A CDN, or `Content Delivery Network`, is a distributed network of servers strategically placed across various geographic locations. The primary purpose of a CDN is to deliver web content, such as images, videos, stylesheets, scripts, and other assets, to users in a faster, more efficient, and reliable manner. CDNs work by caching content on these servers and delivering it to users from the server that is closest to their location. <br><br>
- Why is React known as React ? <br><br>
- What is cross-origin in the script tag ?
  - Cross-origin, in the context of web development, refers to the situation where a web page from one domain (origin) attempts to request resources, such as scripts, images, or data, from a different domain. Browsers enforce a security policy known as the "Same-Origin Policy," which restricts these types of requests for security reasons. The Same-Origin Policy prevents web pages from making requests to domains other than the one that served the web page itself.
  - When you include a `<script>` tag in your HTML code to load an external JavaScript file, you are essentially making a request to the server that hosts that script. This can potentially lead to cross-origin issues if the script you are trying to load is hosted on a domain different from the domain of the page making the request. Browsers may block or restrict such requests to prevent malicious activities like cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
  - However, there are mechanisms to allow controlled cross-origin requests. One common technique is to use `Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)`. CORS is a set of HTTP headers that servers can use to indicate which origins are permitted to access their resources. By configuring the server to include appropriate CORS headers, you can explicitly allow cross-origin requests for specific resources.<br><br>
- What is the difference between React and ReactDOM ?
  - `React` is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook that focuses on building user interfaces. It provides a declarative way to create reusable UI components and manage their state and rendering. React uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to efficiently update and render changes to the actual DOM, minimizing direct manipulation of the real DOM and improving performance.
  - `ReactDOM` is a specific package within the React ecosystem that focuses on the interaction between React and the actual DOM. It provides methods to render React components to the DOM and manage the rendering lifecycle. ReactDOM is responsible for taking the virtual DOM created by React components and updating the real DOM accordingly. The main methods provided by ReactDOM are `ReactDOM.render()`, `ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode()`, `ReactDOM.createPortal()` <br><br>
- What is difference between react.development and react.production.min.js files via CDN ?
  - `react.development.js` is intended for development environments. It includes additional warnings, error messages, and debug information that can be very helpful during the development and debugging process. When an issue occurs in your React application, this version of the library provides more descriptive error messages and warnings that help you identify and address problems in your code. However, this additional information comes at the cost of larger file size and potentially slower performance.
  - `react.production.min.js` is optimized for production environments. It has been minified and stripped of the extra debugging information, warnings, and error messages present in the development version. The minification process reduces the file size, which leads to faster loading times for your application. Additionally, removing unnecessary code related to debugging can improve the performance of your application.

- What is async and defer ?
  - `async` and `defer` are attributes that can be used in HTML script tags to control the loading and execution of external JavaScript files. They are particularly useful for improving the loading performance of web pages by controlling when scripts are fetched and executed in relation to the parsing and rendering of the HTML content.
  - When you include the `async` attribute in a `script` tag, The browser will continue to parse the HTML content and load other resources while fetching the external script in the background. Once the script is fetched, it will be executed immediately, potentially interrupting the parsing and rendering of the HTML. This can lead to scripts being executed out of order if they have dependencies on each other.
  - When you include the `defer` attribute in a script tag, The browser will also continue to parse the HTML content and load other resources while fetching the external script. However, unlike async, scripts with the defer attribute are executed in the order they appear in the HTML, but they are executed after the HTML parsing is complete and before the `DOMContentLoaded` event fires.
